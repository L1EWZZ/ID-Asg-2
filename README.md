# ID-Asg-2
assignment 2 for ID
my group's main target audience will be students of Ngee Ann Poly who have entered the school for the first time at an open house and are inquiring about the courses provided in the IT sector. This webpage has been designed to allow students to have a better understanding about the different courses such as Datascience, Cyber Security, Immersive Media and Information Technology. Since this is an Open House scenario, games and interaction is needed, thus some game functions such as an online quiz and a lucky draw participation forum is included in the webpage. The webpage also explains the importance of programming in the ICT sector and why it is needed in these courses. Users can click on the names of the different courses and find out more of each of them.
