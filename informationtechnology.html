            <h1>What we will learn about Information Technology?</h1>
            <p>In your first year, you will focus on core computing skills 
                in programming, networking, databases and operating systems. 
                In your second year, you will learn how to develop web applications 
                and design IT solutions for businesses. You will also be given the 
                opportunity to research on IT-related topics and develop 
                your digital portfolio. Broaden your skill sets by taking 
                electives that suit your interests and passion.
                In your final year, you will round off your learning journey 
                with a six-month or one-year local or overseas internship with 
                organisations such as OCBC, GovTech, KPMG, IBM, Singtel and 
                Microsoft, or launch your own IT business ideas at our technology 
                hubs. You can also work on a capstone project which will beef up 
                your digital portfolio or complete a second internship with leading 
                organisations like GovTech.
